# Task-Scheduler-with-Priority-Management
A task scheduler with priority management is an application designed to streamline task management by allowing users to assign priorities to their tasks. Utilizing a priority queue data structure, tasks are organized based on their importance, urgency, or other user-defined criteria. This prioritization ensures that high-priority tasks are completed first, optimizing workflow efficiency and helping users focus on critical responsibilities. By providing a clear overview of task priorities, the app empowers users to make informed decisions about task allocation, leading to improved productivity and timely completion of essential tasks. Overall, the task scheduler with priorities serves as a valuable tool for individuals and teams seeking to manage their workload effectively and achieve their goals efficiently.


Usage of the APP:

Identify Tasks:

Determine the specific actions that need to occur and how frequently they should be performed.
Assign Priority Levels: 
Once tasks are identified, assign priority levels to each task based on their importance and urgency. Tasks with higher priority levels will be executed before those with lower priority levels. This ensures that critical tasks are completed promptly.


Schedule Tasks: 

After assigning priority levels, schedule the tasks using Task Scheduler. Add tasks and complete them according to the priority levels assigned. Ensure that tasks with higher priority levels are given appropriate time slots to execute before tasks with lower priority levels. This step optimizes task execution and ensures that essential tasks are completed on time.
